# Project 3: Mobile Flashcards

This project is a requirement of the React Nanodegree Program offered by Udacity. The Mobile Flashcard app presents a list of flash card decks to the user, which they can select to answer the questions within the deck.
Users are also free to add new decks of flash cards and new question cards to their decks for practicing. 

The app comes with a few decks be default, and some quizzes are already in progress or complete in order to better demonstrate the app.

The Mobile Flashcards app will also send users a daily notification if they've forgotten to practice that day.

Try answering a few quizzes and see how you do!
